<h1>3D Scene Rendering in OpenGL</h1>
3D Scene rendering in opengl.
The rendering includes:
<ul>
  <li>3 types of shading: Phong, Gourard and Flat</li>
  <li>Loading of 3d mesh models with assimp</li>
  <li>Different types of light: directional, spot and point lights</li>
  <li>Bezier surface rendering</li>
  <li>Distance based fog rendering</li>
</ul>

This was a great way to test out my abilities in programming 3D graphics and a great introduction in world of 3D graphics on which i hope to improve in my next projects. Either in OpenGL or different graphics APIs(like Vulkan)
<p>The project includes a CmakeLists.txt file to allow for smooth development also on MacOS and Linux :)</p>
<p>Here a couple of screens from the app</p>
